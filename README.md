#### Baldness_Predictor üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Thenga


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Adithyan M C - TKM College of Engineering

### Project Description
Baldness Predictor is a Streamlit web app powered by a CNN model that analyzes front-facing headshots to predict baldness. Upload a photo to see what the AI thinks ‚Äî hair today, gone tomorrow?

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People live in denial about their hairline. Mirrors lie, friends sugarcoat ‚Äî but deep down, everyone fears the forehead creep.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We trained a neural network to stare at your scalp and spill the truth. Upload a photo, and our AI judge delivers a no-nonsense verdict ‚Äî emoji included. Baldness? Detected.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used: Python
- Frameworks used: TensorFlow, Keras, Streamlit
- Libraries used: NumPy, Pillow (PIL), OS
- Tools used: Streamlit CLI, Virtual Environment (venv)

### Implementation
For Software:

# Installation
`git clone <your_repo_url>
cd Baldness_Predictor
python -m venv bald-env
source bald-env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# On Windows use:
# bald-env\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt`

Download baldness_cnn_model.h5
from Releases so that you dont have to train the model

# Run
streamlit run app.py
