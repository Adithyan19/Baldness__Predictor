# [Baldness_Detector] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Thenga]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Adithyan M C] - [TKM College of Engineering]
- Member 2: [Noah John Puthayathu] - [TKM College of Engineering]

### Project Description
[Baldness Predictor is a Streamlit web app powered by a CNN model that analyzes front-facing headshots to predict baldness. Upload a photo to see what the AI thinks ‚Äî hair today, gone tomorrow?]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People live in denial about their hairline. Mirrors lie, friends sugarcoat ‚Äî but deep down, everyone fears the forehead creep.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[People live in denial about their hairline. Mirrors lie, friends sugarcoat ‚Äî but deep down, everyone fears the forehead creep.]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [Languages used: Python]
- [Frameworks used: TensorFlow, Keras, Streamlit]
- [Libraries used: NumPy, Pillow (PIL), OS]
- [Tools used: Streamlit CLI, Virtual Environment (venv)]

For Hardware:
- [List main components]
- [List specifications]
- [List tools required]

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
git clone <your_repo_url>
cd Baldness_Predictor
python -m venv bald-env
source bald-env/Scripts/activate  # On Windows use: bald-env\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt

Download baldness_cnn_model.h5
from Releases so that you dont have to train the model

# Run
streamlit run app.py
